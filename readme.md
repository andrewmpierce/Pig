##To view

##Results
It seems that the most agressive Pig players also had the highest average scores! The most aggressive players only held if their previous roll was a 6, and they had a mean of 45 over a million trials. The more cautious players only average 28. While these aggressive players do seem to bust more often, they also have bigger takes when they don't bust, with which they win out on over the long run.
